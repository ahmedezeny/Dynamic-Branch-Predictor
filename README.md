# Dynamic-Branch-Predictor
accepts the trace in file a.txt
a corelated 2 bits branch Predictor
implemented by a map which key is the xor product of the history register and the pranch adress,
the map should contain at most 2^history-reg-size
we shift the contents of the history register adding the value of the branch
and a tournament branch Predictor
in the corelated 2bit branch Predictor we found that if we increased the length of the history register the hit rate would drop
